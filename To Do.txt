Add achievement system and up time rewards. secret themes and challenges on the page. funny and good looking stuff like pets
and stuff following the mouse.

and ofc all that is after finishing the main page
then fix all themes cuz colors are  so bad

fix the setup.sh file to check for the versions of all needed packages before installing new ones
and before skipping them knowing that there is a version of the needed package even if its old
meaning that instead of checking if there is GoLang or not, it checks if that is the latest version and
the same for nodejs, npm, nginx and anything needed later
